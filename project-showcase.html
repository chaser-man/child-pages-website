    <h2>#1: Personal finance track: FBLA Nationals qualifier</h2>
    <h3>This is definetely one of my greatest academic and developer achievments to date.</h3>
    <p>On the bus ride up to FBLA state Mr. Jones told me and Jett Goimaric that an opening had came available in the web development competion, which was in a few days. Together we immediately began working on the assignment: A personal student finance tracker. Things went well and we ended up qualifying for nationals from it. Nationals was an amazing oppurtunity. We didn't place but we learned a lot and went to DisneyLand!</p>

    <h3>you can view the website <a href="https://coolguyrealx.github.io/Finance">here</a>. If the link doesn't work, use this address: coolguyrealx.github.io/Finance</h3>
    <p>Our website has several features, the first is the Financial Dashboard. It displays users' total balance, all time income, and all time expenses, in a simple and astheatically pleasing format. Next, we have the Add Transaction feature. This is the core functionality of our website. It allows people to a new transaction with these things: type (income/exense), description, amount, date, and category. After that there is the Recent Transactions dashboard which *you guessed it* displays recent transactions. Finally, there is a financial reports feature which allows users to generate customizable graphs that compare their income and expenses. </p>

    <p>One issue we encountered and overcame while developing this website was with the dark mode toggle button. We wanted it to switch the sun/moon emoji depending on if it was in dark or light mode. Neither of use knew how to do this so we had to turn to the internet and figure it out. eventually we divised this line of code:     toggleButton.innerHTML = theme === 'dark' ? '🌙' : '☀️';
      You can see it pictured below.</p>
