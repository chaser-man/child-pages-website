    <h2>#1: Personal finance track: FBLA Nationals qualifier</h2>
    <h3>This is definetely one of my greatest academic and developer achievments to date.</h3>
    <p>On the bus ride up to FBLA state Mr. Jones told me and Jett Goimaric that an opening had came available in the web development competion, which was in a few days. Together we immediately began working on the assignment: A personal student finance tracker. Things went well and we ended up qualifying for nationals from it. Nationals was an amazing oppurtunity. We didn't place but we learned a lot and went to DisneyLand!</p>

    <p>Our website has several features, the first is the Financial Dashboard. It displays users' total balance, all time income, and all time expenses, in a simple and astheatically pleasing format. Next, we have the Add Transaction feature. This is the core functionality of our website. It allows people to a new transaction with these things: type (income/exense), description, amount, date, and category. After that there is the Recent Transactions dashboard which *you guessed it* displays recent transactions. Finally, there is a financial reports feature which allows users to generate customizable graphs that compare their income and expenses. </p>
